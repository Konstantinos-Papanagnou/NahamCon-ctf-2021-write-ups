# Chicken Wings

The only thing this challenge gives us to work with is the chicken_wings file

It only contains emojis. I didn't know during the ctf that there is such thing as a emoji cipher.

There is a website that can decrypt this apparently https://lingojam.com/WingDing

If we copy and paste the emojis we get the flag:
`flag{e0791ce68f718188c0378b1c0a3bdc9e}`
