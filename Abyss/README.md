# Abyss

Abyss was a troll challenge where you connected through ssh to a box. But the trick is that the connection spammed the shit out of your terminal :D

After waiting for a while I'm not sure if it was the timing, i almost gave up and started typing flag and pressing enter and escape. Something out of that worked and i got a flag spam response :D
