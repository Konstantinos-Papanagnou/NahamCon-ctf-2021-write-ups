# Treasure

This challenge gives us a script and a note with numbers that look like indexes. 

With the first look this seemed like some sort of book encryption that used a specific index of a letter at each position of the flag.

Googling online for book cipher we find this website amongst the first results `https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher`

Pasting in the book we got and the note with regard to the fields we get our flag.
